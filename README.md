# <My-Blog-Posts>

## Description

My motivation to build this project was to allow someone to make a blog post and be able to submit. It would the lead to a next page where they could see more posts.
I built this to help create a place to make blog posts.
This problem solved an issue where someone may have that they couldn‚Äôt write a blog post and have it saved while being able to go back to the first page.
I learned how to create a toggle dark mode and light mode button.

## Table of Contents

## Installation

No need to install. The page is accessible to use on any browser.

## Usage

On the first page you are given a form to enter your user, title and content to make a blog post. You then have a submit button to submit. Once submitted, you will be directed to the second page where you can now see more posts. On both pages, there is a button on the top right (emojis). You may hit the buttons to toggle light mode and dark mode. On the second page, you are given a back page on top right to go back to the first page to make another post.
